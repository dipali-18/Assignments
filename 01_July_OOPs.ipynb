    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Ans-  Purpose of OOPS is to hold entire data into single object and then pass this data to other methods and object. \n",
    "It is a programming language which is based on class and object. \n",
    "By using OOPs we can structure the program into simple, reusable piece of code.\n",
    "Goals of object-oriented programming language : Adaptability - means the software may run on different generations and \n",
    "    grows over a long lifetime.\n",
    "    To reuse the code in which child classes uses the properties of the base class. \n",
    "    To hold entire data into a single object such that it would be easy to pass this to other methods and objects. \n",
    "Multiprocessing is also in object-oriented programming. Binding of data to avoid data loss. \n",

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "Ans—every single entity of the class is an object in python. Object is the instance of the class. And class is the blueprint of the object(information of the object). E.g dictionary, str, nums are object of corresponding built-in class. Objects are copies of class.\n"

    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "Ans—Class is the user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. using class we build data and functionality together. A class is a code template for creating objects Whenever we build new class means we build new object and ultimately create the new instance. E.g car is the class. It holds information about the car that we assign or define in the instance.\n"

    "Ans-Attributes means information about the class. So any variable which is defined/stored in the class/instance is attribute. And any function that is defined/stored in the class/instance is Method. Methods receive an instance of the class, conventionally called self , as the first argument.\n",
    "e.g. car is the class—then (model and price) is the attribute and when we define display(self) is the method. \n"

    "Ans—Class variable is the single entity. Class variables are common to all instances of a class. Single class contains/holds/stores data that is shared among all the instances. But in one class there may be many instances. E.g. Bank is the class and we created deposit and withdraw as an instance. Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as object properties.\n"
